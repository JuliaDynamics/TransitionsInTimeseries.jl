For each surrogate, the indicator and then change metric timeseries is extracted. The values of the surrogate change metrics form a distribution of values (one at each time point). The value of the original change metric is compared to that of the surrogate distribution and a p-value is extracted according to the specified tail. The p-value is compared with p to claim significance. After using SurrogatesSignificance, you may access the full p-values before thresholding in the field .pvalues (to e.g., threshold with different p).\n\nThe p-value is simply the proportion of surrogate change metric values that exceed (for tail = :right) or subseed (tail = :left) the original change metric at each given time point. Use tail = :left if the surrogate data are expected to have higher change metric, discriminatory statistic values. This is the case for statistics that quantify entropy. For statistics that quantify autocorrelation, use tail = :right instead. For anything else, use the default tail = :both. An iterable of tail values can also be given, in which case a specific tail is used for each change metric in IndicatorsChangesResults.\n\nNote that the raw p-values can be accessed in the field .pvalues, after calling the significant_transitions function with SurrogatesSignificance, in case you wish to obtain a different threshold of the p-values.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/#TransitionsInTimeseries.QuantileSignificance","page":"API","title":"TransitionsInTimeseries.QuantileSignificance","text":"QuantileSignificance(; p = 0.95, tail = :both) <: TransitionsSignificance\n\nA configuration struct for significance testing significant_transitions.
