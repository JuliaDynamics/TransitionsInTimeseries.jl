    SlopeChangeConfig <: ChangesConfig
    SlopeChangeConfig(; indicator = nothing, kw...)

A configuration that can be given to [`estimate_changes`](@ref).
It estimates a change of slope in the timeseries by fitting two
connected linear segments to the timeseries,
returning the results (i.e., the two-linear fits) as [`SlopeChangeResults`](@ref).

Currently, significance of `SlopeChangeConfig` results can only be
checked with [`SlopeChangeSignificance`](@ref).

## Keyword arguments

- `indicator = nothing`: a function f(x) -> Real.
  The slope fitting is then done over an indicator of the timeseries, which itself
  is estimated via a sliding window exactly as in [`SlidingWindowConfig`](@ref).
  When this is `nothing` the slope change is applied to the timeseries directly.
- `width_ind, stride_ind, whichtime`: exactly as in [`SlidingWindowConfig`](@ref)
  if `indicator` is not `nothing`.

    SlopeChangeResults <: ChangesResults

A struct containing the output of [`estimate_changes`](@ref) used with
[`SlopeChangeConfig`](@ref). It can be used for further analysis, visualization,
or given to [`significant_transitions`](@ref). The only significance type
that you can use this with [`significant_transitions`](@ref) is
[`SlopeChangeSignificance`](@ref).

It has the following fields that the user may access:

- `x`: the input timeseries.
- `t`: the time vector of the input timeseries.
- `x_indicator`: the indicator timeseries.
- `t_indicator`: the time vector of the indicator timeseries.
- `t_change`: the time the slope changes.
- `fitparams = a, b, c, d`: the fitted linear coefficients, `a + b*t` before
  `t_change` and `c + d*t` after `t_change`.
